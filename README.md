# HelloWorld

A bare-bones Omeka-S module.  Intended as a tutorial and a starter template 
for people who are new to PHP, Laminas and Omeka-S Development.  


## Installation

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules)

## To Use

Once installed, this module extends all of your omeka-sites with the hello controller which has 2 actions: Greet and Index.  To see them in action, gpo to a site page and add "helloworld" to your site's URL string in your browser.  for example:

...
http://[server]/omeka-s/s/[siteslug]/helloworld
...

Where [server] is the web server for your Omeka-S installation and [siteslug] is the slug for your site.

If the module is installed correctly, you will be presented with a page generated by the views/hello/index.phtml template.  The index page includes the view/common/hello-form.phtml form element.  Enter a name in the form and push the Greet button.  When the form is  submitted, the URL is extended with the ?greet parameter, and a new page is generated using the views/hello/greet.phtml template that also includes the hello-form element.  

If this functionality was useful for your sites, you could add the hello-form element to any of your pages by adding it to pages that are part of your site's custom theme. 

Otherwise, you can modify the module with new controllers and actions.
